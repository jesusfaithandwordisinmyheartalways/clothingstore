OVERVIEW:

Developed a secure full-stack e-commerce application with MongoDB, Node.js, and React, implementing JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, 
secure cookie storage, PayPal payment integration, environment variable protection, and input validation to enhance security and user experience.”


FEATURES:
  1 	MongoDB Connection Security – Uses environment variables (MONGODB_URI) to securely manage database credentials, preventing exposure in source code.
	2.	Environment Variables Protection – Implements dotenv to securely store API keys, secrets, and credentials, reducing security risks.
	3.	Password Hashing – Uses bcrypt to securely hash passwords before storing them in the database, preventing plaintext password leaks.
	4.	JWT Authentication – Implements jsonwebtoken to generate secure, expiring tokens for user authentication, preventing session hijacking.
	5.	Secure Cookie Storage – Stores authentication tokens in HTTP-only, secure, and same-site restricted cookies to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.
	6.	User Input Validation – Validates name, email, and password using regex to prevent invalid or malicious user inputs.
	7.	Brute Force Protection – Tracks failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.
	8.	Secure Payment Integration – Configures PayPal SDK with client_id and client_secret stored in environment variables, protecting financial transactions.
	9.	Order Data Validation – Ensures orders contain valid structure before processing, preventing malformed or fraudulent requests.
	10.	Error Handling & Logging – Implements structured error handling to prevent sensitive data leaks in API responses while logging errors for debugging.
